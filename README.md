## persian-word-extractor
This script creates a list of unique words from Persian text. Words are sorted by the frequency that they appear in the source.txt file. This is a new project, there could be major bugs in the code.
**Words with accent marks are excluded from results.**

## How to use:
1. Create a file named 'source.txt' in root directory and paste source text inside.
2. Run 'main.py'
3. Choose between offline (sourced from 'source.txt') or online (builds a list of fa.wikipedia.org links from initial link) mode.
4. Follow CLI instructions.
5. Results will be written to 'output.txt' in root directory.
