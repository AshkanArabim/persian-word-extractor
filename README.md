# persian-word-extractor
This is a script that can be used to extract a list of unique words from a Persian text. Words are sorted by the frequency that they appear in the source.txt file. This is a new project, there could be major bugs in the code.

# How to use:
1-Create a file named 'source.txt' in root directory and paste source text inside.
2-Run 'main.py'
3-Choose between offline (sourced from 'source.txt') or online mode (builds a list of fa.wikipedia.org links from initial link)
4-Follow cli instructions.
5-Results will be written to 'output.txt' in root directory.
